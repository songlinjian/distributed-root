1.  Introduction

   The Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) is a vital component of the
   Internet infrastructure mapping human-readable names into Internet
   Protocol (IP) addresses.  DNS is designed and built on a single root,

   known as the Root Server System with editorial function, signing
   function and publication function of the Root zone.

   As part of IANA function, DNS Root zone management has a long
   history [SAC067] and experienced technical changes (IPv6, DNSSEC,
   Anycast, etc) as well as policy changes (IANA transition, new gTLDs).
   None of the previous changes violates the assumption that a centralized
   entity responsible for one particular function in the Root zone
   management.  For example, IANA takes the role of editorial and Key
   Signing functions.  VeriSign takes the role of Zone signing and
   publication function which distributes the root zone to 13 root
   servers and their instances.  This centralized design fits the need
   to keep a single, globally unique DNS Root [RFC2826]

   In recent years, as the rise of DNS privacy [RFC7626], high resiliency
   and Internet policy concerns on Internet infrastructure, thoughts on
   introducing fault-tolerance and decentralization technology into DNS
   are getting popular.  Some people suggest that "if we were designing
   a next-generation DNS using today's technology, it should be possible
   to remove the technical requirement for a central authority over the
   root" [RFC8324].  Yeti DNS Testbed [RFC8483] proposed and built a
   model introducing three ZSK signers and root zone distributors.
   Yeti's model shows a form of root "democratic" governance but it is
   not fault-tolerant and scalable enough, technically speaking [FDMA].
   It gives us motivation to upgrade Yeti Root to a "higher" level by
   introducing the properties of decentralization and fault-tolerance.

   This document describes the proposed architecture of a Fault-tolerant
   Root for Yeti DNS.  It results from an ongoing discussions during the
   launch of phase-2 for Yeti DNS Project towards a decentralized Root
   system.  It firstly reviews the state of art including how IANA and
   Yeti Root works, as well as some previous proposals in this field.
   It proposes to introduce Threshold Signing cryptographic technology
   to bring redundancy for Yeti Root DNSSEC.  It also introduces a layer
   of DM network with a consensus algorithm to keep the consistency of
   Root zone and meta data.

   Note that it is only high-level description of the design.  Details
   of some modules are to be contained in accompanying documentation.

2.  Background and Motivation

2.1.  Breif Review of IANA Root

   According to [SAC067], the components of IANA Root involve four
   independent parties after IANA Transition: 1) the change requester,
   usually the manager(s) or administrator(s) of the TLD; 2) ICANN/PTI,
   as the IANA Functions Operator; 3) VeriSign, as the Root Zone

   Maintainer (RZM); and 4) the Root Server Operators.  Their
   relationship and data flow among them are shown in figure 1 below.

             Figure 1: Root zone update process and data flow

   There are two important roles in the figure: IANA operator and Root
   zone maintainer (RZM). They are the centralized roles in the whole
   process regarding root zone editorial, signing and publication
   functions.

   ICANN/PTI as the IANA operator is the interface to TLD operators and
   is responsible to collect root zone change requests and to vet and
   process DS records sent from TLD operators.  ICANN/PTI is also
   responsible for management of the root zone KSK, including generation,
   publication, and use for signing in cooperation with the Internet
   community according to [DNSSEC-Root].

   VeriSign, as the Root zone Maintainer (RZM), is responsible for
   incorporating DNSSEC-related changes into the root zone file, signing
   the file with the ZSK, and distributing the signed root zone file to
   the root servers.  It is also referred as to Distribution Master
   (DM). RZM and DM are both used in the following sessions as the role of

   signing and publishing root zone.  Note that there is an exchange of
   ZSK and Signed DNSKEY set between IANA operator and RZM.

   In Yeti Root, the role of VeriSign is replaced by three DMs which pull
   the unsigned zone from IANA, sign it with their ZSK and distribute
   the root zone among 25 root servers independently. This approach
   introduces certain redundancy using the current DNS technology.

2.2.  Previous Proposals and discussions

   When it refers to decentralization technology, Blockchain comes to
   people's mind, which is a buzzle word during recent years.  Based on
   Blockchain, there are some naming service systems like ENS
   (https://ens.domains/ ) in Ethereum network and Namecoin
   (https://namecoin.org/) in Bitcoin netowrk. They introduce .eth and
   .bit respectively as special TLDs used only in their overlay network
   as well as special registration and resolution protocols. They are
   not DNS, but referred to as Blockchain-based DNS in literature
   though.

   In Yeti DNS Project, from the beginning, we keep boundaries for One
   Unique Internet Identifier and not amend the IANA name space.
   However, the Blockchain-based DNS does not fit DNS in operation
   network. They have different name space and use different resolving
   protocols. As introduced in Figure 1, the Root system is decoupled
   into three functions: editing, signing and publication. It is
   possible to keep the root zone intact and make changes to signing and
   publication functions to meet our requirements.

   There are some approaches that introduce an alternative method to access the
   unique name space. Loopback Root [RFC8483] is one alternative root
   zone publication approach in which the signed root zone is replicated
   in resolver. Changes are made only in publication function.

   Yeti DNS [RFC8483] is one example that made changes in both signing and
   publication functions. Yeti root zone is signed by three DMs and
   distributes the root zone to a different set of root servers. Yeti
   Multi-DM model makes changes to signing function (Zone Signing), but
   the current version of Multi-DM does not scale due to an increased DNS
   response caused by introducing multiple ZSKs.

   On Root signing function, John Ihren and Bill Manning [draft-ihren-
   dnsext-threshold-validation] once proposed a mechanism called
   threshold validation to improve trust and redundancy for DNSSEC
   Keys.  Basically it requires the resolvers to validate multiple signatures
   signed by multiple trust entities.  If the number of successful
   validation reaches a threshold, then the outcome of multiple
   validations as a whole is VALID.  Similar with Yeti model, it does

   not scale given the limitation of the DNS packet size (contains multiple
   KEY and signature).  It also requires changes on every validating
   resolver which makes it an impossible task.

   Is it possible to introduce multiple independent Signers without
   changing the DNSSEC validation interface, and without augmenting the
   size of DNS response as well? The work of NIC Chile on "Distributed
   Threshold Cryptography" [Threshold-Chile] gives a clue which was
   introduced in 2019 during a Yeti workshop in Tokyo.  With Threshold
   Cryptography scheme, it is possible to aggregate all types of
   primitives (secret keys, public keys, signatures) and the result is
   always another valid primitive to fit the interface of PKCS#11
   [PKCS11].  However, there is still a centralized roll called SD
   (Signing Dealer) in charge of distributing zone file, collecting and
   aggregating the signatures for each update of the root zone.

3.  Framework of Fault-tolerant Root

3.1.  Hypotheses and Goal

   To design a distributed system which does not rely upon one entity,
   there should be some hypotheses of the participants to limit the
   scope of risk.  There is one notable assumption that all participants
   of the fault-tolerant root designed in this draft are cooperative and
   with no malicious intention.  It means that the system is designed
   against technical failures like data inconsistency, single point of
   failure, etc.  It can be achieved by adopting a selective and
   invitation-based strategy to choose a group of participants with
   credit. It is similar to the concept of permission chain in
   Blockchain context.

   Based on the related work and the hypotheses, the goal and technical
   requirement of desirable fault-tolerant root are listed as follows:

   o  Introducing redundancy and fault-tolerance property on both
      signing and publication functions in case of single point failure;

   o  Providing consistency check on to-be published root zone in case
      of date inconsistency in a distributed manner;

   o  New proposed scheme SHOULD be deployed on authority server only
      which means that no change is required on the recursive server.  Chile
      NIC's proposal as a kind of PKCS#11 provider is a good starting
      point.

   o  New proposed scheme SHOULD not be introducing huge increase (>1200
      octets) on the size of DNS response.

              Figure 2: The framework in Fault-tolerant Root

   The framework in fault-tolerant root is shown in Figure 2.  There are
   several roles similar to ones in Figure 1 like TLD Operators and
   Root servers.  The difference in the interaction with TLD Operators
   is that in Figure 1 TLD operators can push zone change request and DS
   to ICANN/PTI. But in Yeti, it is to pull the data and generate DS
   record locally. From the TLD data point of view, they are mostly
   identical except that some NS records are present in TLD zone but not in
   root zone.

   Differently from a single RZM in IANA root, there is a group of Yeti DMs
   (>= 3) which are fully connected as a cluster and form a Yeti DM
   network.  The Yeti DM network takes the role of signing and publishing
   Root zone acting as one DM with the assistance of two key components:
   threshold signing and consensus algorithm.  It is desirable



Song                    Expires December 5, 2019                [Page 6]

   that a failure on small parts of Yeti DM network (a
   threshold number of DMs) will not be able to take down the whole
   system. Note that the numbers of DM and threshold are testing
   targets which help us to understand the limit of the system.

   There is a special role in Figure 2, the KeyGen Dealer, which is
   responsible to generate the keys (or key shares) to each Yeti DM.
   Special secret sharing algorithm is used to generate keys with
   property of threshold.  In Appendix A, there is an introduction of
   threshold signing which will help readers in understanding the basic
   primitives and process. Note that this document does not dive into
   specific threshold signing algorithm and protocol. Instead, related
   data flow and function interface will be introduced.

3.3.  The Data Flow and Process

   In Figure 3, there is a chart of data flow and process as a routine
   for Yeti root zone update from one Yeti DM's point of view.

   Basically, as an input, each Yeti DM periodically pulls the TLD data
   information (KSK, NS, glue) from each TLD authoritative servers. As
   a sequence there are 5 steps: 0) Key generation, 1) Unsigned
   root zone generation, 2) Sign the zone with the key shares, 3) Signed
   Root zone generation with consensus among all Yeti DMs, 4) Publish the signed
   Root zone file to Yeti root servers.

   Note that steps 1), 2) and 3) require Yeti DMs to coordinate and act
   as an "One DM". It means that in each step, each Yeti DM should
   broadcast the values of root zone, signature, signed root zone to
   others until final consensus on that values is reached.  In
   Appendix B, there is an introduction of a consensus algorithm which will
   help readers to understand the basic property and interaction between
   Yeti DMs.  Note that we will not dive into specific consensus
   algorithm in this draft.

   focus on "what to do" other than "how to do".  More detailed how-to-
   do specification is to be defined in the next version or in other
   documentation.

3.3.1.  Step 0: Key Generation

   A Key Generation process (KeyGen for short) is required in the
   beginning of Yeti Root system setup. It can be a centralized process
   with a group of people and broadcast globally via an auditable process

   protection-key-ceremonies-13may17-en.pdf).

   In the context of Fault-tolerant Root, the KeyGen process has at least
   two outcomes: 1) KSK shares for each Yeti DM, 2) ZSK shares for each
   Yeti DM.  Differently from IANA Key Ceremony, Key Signing process is
   done by each Yeti DM independently. For secret KSK and ZSK, there is no need to
   be maintained and kept safe in a special device because they are not
   required in the following process. They can be destroyed after
   KeyGen being done or kept for emergency purpose.

   Note that the KeyGen dealer in Figure 2 and 3 is more light-weighted
   than the Signing Dealer in NIC Chile's proposal, but it has still a
   centralized role involving human activities in the system.  It is
   technical possible to further remove the KeyGen dealer role by
   deploying a certain Distributed Key Generation (DKG) method
   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_key_generation).

3.3.2.  Step 1: Generate unsigned Root zone

   According to RFC8483, the Yeti unsigned root zone is composed of two
   part: APEX records of Root and the TLD data.  APEX data can be
   specified in the beginning. (To Be Defined for SOA, NS and DNSKEY
   respectively)

   TLD data includes DS record, NS RRset and glue of a particular TLD.
   Periodically TLD data is pulled from the authority servers of each TLD.
   The authority list of TLD is on IANA website
   (www.iana.org/domains/root/db).  Note that DS record of each TLD can
   be generated using their KSK information.

   It is worth mentioning that each Yeti DM will pull the data
   independently and save them as a <key,value> pair.  More specifically
   the <name, type, class> is the key, and <TTL, RRset> is the value.
   Each one of the values are considered as to-be-confirmed state until
   all Yeti DMs agree on the values via the consensus network running
   a consensus protocol.  If every Yeti DM follows the same procedure as a
   protocol, the confirmed that the unsigned root zone will be formed finally.

3.3.3.  Step 2: Threshold Signing and and Aggregation

   Each Yeti DM will use the key share to sign the zone delivering RRSIG
   for each RRset. The RRSIG of each RRset per Yeti DM (with DM ID)
   will be broadcast via Yeti DM consensus network.  Finally each Yeti
   DM will connect all RRSIG records signed by all Yeti DMs which is
   confirmed via the consensus network.

   With all RRSIG records, Yeti DM can aggregate them into one RRSIG
   record using the Aggregation function. In Threshold Signing scheme, if
   the number of failures of DM signing is less than threshold t, the
   system will survive by aggregating a signature which will output
   VAILD validated against the Public Key.

3.3.4.  Step 3: Generate Signed Root zone

   For each RRset, an aggregated RRSIG is generated locally by each Yeti
   DM.  All aggregated RRSIGs are to be confirmed via consensus network.
   After confirmation, a Signed Root zone will be generated without
   inconsistency.

3.3.5.  Step 4: Publish the Signed Root zone

   Yeti DM will send a notify to all root servers.  Root server will
   configure its Zone transfer ACL with invited Yeti DM.  It is possible
   that a root server receives more than one notify in a short period.
   Only the first notify carrying the new serial of SOA will trigger the
   zone transfer request.

   It is possible to configure a smaller mapping of DMs and Root servers
   to reduce the notify storm.  For example, one DM only notify 5 root
   servers and 3 DM are configured in each root server's ACL.

Appendix A.  Basic componets and operation of Threshold Signing

   Before introducing new design of Yeti Root, it is necessary to
   briefly introduce the property of Threshold Signing with basic
   primitives and operation which is the key components of the fault-
   tolerant root.

   Generally speaking, threshold signing requires two crypto components:

   o  The first component is a key generation process with secret
      sharing scheme which generates multiple secret key shares from the

      secret key.  Secret sharing system is also called a (t,n)-
      threshold scheme due to the property that a number (number >= t)
      of secret shares can reconstruct the secret to be used to sign.
      However, the secret sharing scheme itself requires a dealer to recover
      the original secret key which is also possible to be stolen and
      compromised during that period.  To avoid the risk, a special
      signature scheme is needed as the second component.

   o  A signature scheme with the property of primitives aggregation is
      the second key component.  With that signature scheme, all types of
      primitives like secret keys, public keys, signatures can be
      aggregated, and the result is always another valid primitive.  The
      secret key shares generated in the first component are also valid
      secret keys which can be used to sign a message and thus create a
      valid signature.  The dealer or anyone can take t-of-n of these
      signature shares to recover a new signature which is identical to
      what would have been created if the original secret key would have
      been used.  So the secret key would never appear or been observed
      after key generate process.  (BLS Signature Scheme
      [I-D.boneh-bls-signature] is one example of aggregatable signature
      scheme)

   Based on the components of threshold signing, there are several
   operations provided to fulfill the threshold signing process

   KeyGen:   Given the key_pair (public key and secret key), the number
             of authorities (n) and the threshold (t), KeyGen operation
             can generate a group of secret key shares (sks_group) by
             performing KeyGen(key_pair, t, n) which outputs sks_group

   Sign:     For each secret key share (sks), it can be used to sign the
             message (msg) to generate a signature share (sigma) by
             performing Sign(sk, msg) which outputs sigma.  Note that a
             group of secret key share (sks_group) can generate a group
             of signatures share (sigma_group)

   Aggregate_sigma:  Given any t out of n signatures share signed by
             secret key shares, an aggregated signature can be generated
             by performing Aggregate_sigma(sigma_1, ... sigma_t) which
             output VALID and sigma_aggregated.  However if
             Aggregate_sigma failed and outputs not aggregated
             signature, it means that not enough (less then t) valid
             signature shares are collected.  This operation is a key
             design, introducing (n-t) redundancy which means if no more
             than (n-t+1) keys were compromised, the system will not be
             taken down.  (To Be Confirmed and double checked with crypto
             scholar)

   Verify:   The Verify operation is the same as other signing and
             validating process, by performing Verify(PK, msg,
             sigma_aggregated) outputs VALID if no error here.

   Note that there is a still a centralized dealer to generate key and
   key shares and distributed to n players but just in the beginning.
   The threshold signing described above requires no dealer in each
   update of msg.  In the context of root, after the key generation process
   (like a Key ceremony), all process of root zone signing and
   publication can be done in a distributed and automatic manner.

Appendix B.  Consensus algorithm

   It is quoted that consensus is a fundamental problem in fault-
   tolerant distributed systems.  Consensus involves multiple servers
   agreeing on values.  Once they reach a decision on a value, that
   decision is final.  In this section, there is a brief introduction of
   Raft consensus algorithm (https://raft.github.io/) as a background.
